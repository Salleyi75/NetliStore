I am 28 years old and I work as a legal assistant in a firm </div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y2e56 ffee fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of advocates. A typical day in my life starts at about 6:00am, when I have my </div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y2e57 ffee fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">morning devotions. After that I get myself ready for work. I try to look chic and </div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y2e58 ffee fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">presentable yet comfortable and corporately dressed. As lawyers, we can wear </div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y2e59 ffee fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">any colour for work, as long as it does not scream at anybody. Personally red </div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y2e5a ffee fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is my colour, but for work I wear grey, black, dark green or brown. Around </div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y2e5b ffee fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">7:15am I head for work.</div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y2e5c ffee fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I have breakfast at around 9:00am at my place of work. The kind of breakfast </div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y2e5d ffee fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I have depends on my mood.  I prefer taking water or yogurt and anything </div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y2e5e ffee fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ranging from a hot samosa, chapatti to katogo. Rarely do I take tea.</div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y2e5f ffee fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">My day depends on what is to be done; I am supposed to be at work by </div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y2e60 ffee fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">8:00am. The first thing I do is update myself; I read the papers and then dive </div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y2e61 ffee fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">straight into my work. It involves drafting court papers, writing letters, meeting </div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y2e62 ffee fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">clients etc. There is an assortment of things to do in the legal profession. I deal </div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y2e63 ffee fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with court cases, but I am not allowed to argue in court because I am not yet </div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y2e64 ffee fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">enrolled.</div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y2e65 ffee fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I work through lunchtime especially when I am very busy. I like eating fruits </div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y2e66 ffee fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">at my desk for lunch and only eat food when I’m very hungry. My day usually </div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y2e67 ffee fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ends at 5:30pm, but when I have a deadline to meet, I stay at work till late. I </div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y2e68 ffee fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">am a perfectionist. I keep cross-checking. It is just the satisfaction that I have </div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y2e69 ffee fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">done something to the best of my ability. Sometimes I cannot avoid taking </div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y2e6a ffee fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">work home if it is needed the following day.</div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y2e6b ffee fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">My work is challenging and I love it.

But if it is too easy, I </div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y2e6d ffee fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">feel cheated, as though I am just sitting on all my potential. There is something </div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y2e6e ffee fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">new to learn everyday about the law. The fact that I am gaining experience </div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y2e6f ffee fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">keeps me going. It is nice to be a lawyer – it is a decent and cool profession. It </div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y2e70 ffee fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">involves helping people and I love it.</div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y2e71 ffee fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Out of work, I love reading novels, religious literature and anything that can </div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y2e72 ffee fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">give me a good laugh, watching movies and surfing the Internet.</div><div class="t m0 xf h17 y2e73 ffe0 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"> </div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data="{&quot;ctm&quot;:[1.498566,0.000000,0.000000,1.498566,0.000000,0.000000]}"></div><div class="divider" style="position: absolute; height: 1px; top: 1011px;"></div><div class="divider" style="position: absolute; height: 1px; top: 1185px;"></div><iframe src="assets/h5phtml/SB12 R4 G P277.html" style="position: absolute; height: 2000px; top: 1048px;"></iframe></div>
