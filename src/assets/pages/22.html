It is his autobiographical account of </div><div class="t m0 x37 h10 y2d8 ffc fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">growing up in a village in Guinea, in West Africa. His father was a goldsmith and had a workshop. </div><div class="t m0 x37 h10 y2d9 ffc fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He employed a number of apprentices – young boys who were learning the craft – and they lived </div><div class="t m0 x37 h10 y2da ffc fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the family compound. Read the text and answer the questions below.</div><div class="t m0 x4f h14 y2db ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In the morning when, after some persuasion, we rose, we found the breakfast ready. My mother </div><div class="t m0 x4f h10 y2dc ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">awoke at <span class="ffc">dawn</span> to prepare it. We all sat around the great steaming dishes: my parents, sisters, </div><div class="t m0 x4f h14 y2dd ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brothers, and the apprentices. There was one dish for the men, and another for my mother and </div><div class="t m0 x4f h14 y2de ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my sisters.</div><div class="t m0 x17 h10 y2df ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It would not be exactly right for me to say that my mother <span class="ffc">presided</span> over the meal: my </div><div class="t m0 x4f h14 y2e0 ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">father presided over it. Nevertheless, it was the presence of my mother that made itself felt first </div><div class="t m0 x4f h14 y2e1 ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of all. Was that because she had prepared the food, because meals are things which are mainly </div><div class="t m0 x4f h10 y2e2 ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a woman’s business? Maybe. But there was something more: my mother, by the <span class="ffc">mere</span> fact of her </div><div class="t m0 x4f h14 y2e3 ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">presence, and even though she was not seated directly in front of the men’s dish, saw to it that </div><div class="t m0 x4f h10 y2e4 ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">everything was done according to her own rules; and those rules were <span class="ffc">strict</span>.</div><div class="t m0 x17 h10 y2e5 ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Thus it was forbidden to <span class="ffc">cast my gaze</span> upon guests older than myself, and I was also </div><div class="t m0 x4f h14 y2e6 ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">forbidden to talk: my whole attention had to be fixed on the food before me. In fact, it would </div><div class="t m0 x4f h14 y2e7 ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have been most impolite to chatter at that moment. Even my younger brothers knew that this </div><div class="t m0 x4f h10 y2e8 ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was no time to <span class="ffc">jabber</span>: this was the hour to pay honour to the food. Older people observed </div><div class="t m0 x4f h14 y2e9 ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">more or less the same silence. This was not the only rule: those concerning cleanliness were </div><div class="t m0 x4f h14 y2ea ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">no less important. Finally, if there was meat on the dish, I was not allowed to take it from the </div><div class="t m0 x4f h14 y2eb ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">centre of the dish, but only from the part directly in front of me, and my father would put more </div><div class="t m0 x4f h10 y2ec ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">within my reach if he saw I needed it. Any other behaviour would have been <span class="ffc">frowned upon</span> and </div><div class="t m0 x4f h10 y2ed ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">quickly <span class="ffc">reprimanded</span>. In any case, my <span class="ffc">portion</span> was always so <span class="ffc">plentiful</span> that I should never have </div><div class="t m0 x4f h14 y2ee ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been tempted to take more than I was given.</div><div class="t m0 x17 h14 y2ef ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When the meal was over, I would say: ‘Thank you, Father.’ The apprentices would say:</div><div class="t m0 x4f h10 y2f0 ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"> ‘Thank you, master.’ Then I would <span class="ffc">bow</span> to my mother and say: ‘The meal was good, Mother.’ </div><div class="t m0 x4f h10 y2f1 ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">My brothers, my sisters, the apprentices did <span class="ffc">likewise</span>. My parents replied, ‘Thank you’ to each </div><div class="t m0 x4f h10 y2f2 ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one of them. Such was the rule. My father would certainly have been <span class="ffc">offended</span> to see it broken, </div><div class="t m0 x4f h10 y2f3 ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but it was my mother, with her quicker temper, who <span class="ffc">rebuked</span> any <span class="ffc">transgression</span>. My father’s </div><div class="t m0 x4f h10 y2f4 ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mind was with his work, and he left these <span class="ffc">prerogatives</span> to her. </div><div class="t m0 x3a h17 y2f5 fff fsb fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">1</div><div class="t m0 x50 h17 y2f6 fff fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"> </div><div class="t m0 x51 h10 y2f7 ffc fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What is the main point of each paragraph?
