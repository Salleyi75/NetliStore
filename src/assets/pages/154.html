These ridges were beaten </div><div class="t m0 x29 h14 y19d4 ff6f fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">by men who stood on one foot and stamped with the other, until the earth was beaten well </div><div class="t m0 x29 h14 y19d5 ff6f fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">against the thatch where it came to the ground, and formed a hard substance to carry off the </div><div class="t m0 x29 h14 y19d6 ff6f fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">water from the roof and prevent it from running into the house. The workmen made a polished </div><div class="t m0 x29 h14 y19d7 ff6f fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">surface to the beaten earth with their iron hoes, used as trowels, and at the doorway they made </div><div class="t m0 x29 h14 y19d8 ff6f fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a ridge, which tapered from both sides upwards, so that it was a high rim to a saucer, and kept </div><div class="t m0 x29 h14 y19d9 ff6f fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">any water from running into the house during rainstorms. </div><div class="t m0 x29 h14 y19da ff6f fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As soon as the earth of the floor dried and cracked, the men beat it again until all the cracks </div><div class="t m0 x29 h14 y19db ff6f fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were filled up, and finally they smeared the whole with a mixture of clay and cow dung, which </div><div class="t m0 x29 h14 y19dc ff6f fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">made an excellent floor. The thatch over the doorway was neatly cut back by the thatcher; it </div><div class="t m0 x29 h14 y19dd ff6f fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was the custom to cut the under part long and the upper part shorter, the exact opposite to the </div><div class="t m0 x29 h14 y19de ff6f fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">English method. The floor-beaters for the king each received a hoe when the work was finished; </div><div class="t m0 x29 h14 y19df ff6f fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but if they had also to level the courtyard in which a house stood, the king gave them a goat </div><div class="t m0 x29 h14 y19e0 ff6f fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in addition to the hoe; this they killed and ate on the spot before anyone went to live in the </div><div class="t m0 x29 h14 y19e1 ff6f fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">house. When chiefs wanted these men to work for them, they paid them heavily, the price being </div><div class="t m0 x29 h14 y19e2 ff6f fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sometimes as high as a cow for making one floor.   </div><div class="t m0 x29 h14 y19e3 ff6f fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The door was made of reeds by another set of workmen who were the king’s door-makers. The </div><div class="t m0 x29 h14 y19e4 ff6f fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">door-maker measured the height and breadth of the doorway with a reed, and then carried the </div><div class="t m0 x29 h14 y19e5 ff6f fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">measurements to his own house, where he made the door. He used three and sometimes four </div><div class="t m0 x29 h14 y19e6 ff6f fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">long sticks which he placed one near the top of the door, another near the bottom and one </div><div class="t m0 x29 h14 y19e7 ff6f fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">between them; to these he stitched reeds of the necessary length, and when he had completed </div><div class="t m0 x29 h14 y19e8 ff6f fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one side with one layer of reeds, he turned the door over and stitched a second layer to the </div><div class="t m0 x29 h14 y19e9 ff6f fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">opposite side. When the door was made for the king, the stitching had to be done with cane, </div><div class="t m0 x29 h14 y19ea ff6f fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but for ordinary houses bark was used. The reeds were trimmed off at the ends when the door </div><div class="t m0 x29 h14 y19eb ff6f fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was finished, so that it might be the right length; these doors were always made larger than the </div><div class="t m0 x29 h14 y19ec ff6f fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">opening, so that, when they were put up, the opening was well covered both at the top and on </div><div class="t m0 x29 h14 y19ed ff6f fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">either side.</div><div class="t m0 x1d h19 y19ee ff6d fsf fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">Revision <span class="_ _7"></span>2 <span class="_ _7"></span>(Units <span class="_ _7"></span>4–6)</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data="{&quot;ctm&quot;:[1.498566,0.000000,0.000000,1.498566,0.000000,0.000000]}"></div></div>
