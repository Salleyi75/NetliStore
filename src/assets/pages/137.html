This is known as trademarking; it means </div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y16b4 ff77 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">international trademarks have been obtained for speciality coffee grown in </div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y16b5 ff77 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Harar, Yirgacheffe, and Sidamo. This allows the coffee growers to decide which </div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y16b6 ff77 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">distributors they will grant licences to, and what terms they must abide by in </div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y16b7 ff77 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">order to sell their specialty coffee. However, trademarking is not without its </div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y16b8 ff77 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">problems. It has faced opposition from some international distributors, who </div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y16b9 ff77 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prefer to use their own trademarks. It also makes high demands on the coffee </div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y16ba ff77 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">producers to ensure quality control is maintained; the government is also </div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y16bb ff77 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">required to enforce minimum standards in coffee production processes. In </div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y16bc ff77 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">addition, skilful marketing is required to make the trademarked coffee brands </div><div class="t m0 x16 h1d y16bd ff77 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">known in the developed world.
