The year I spent in Standard 2 was as unlike that of Standard I as it is possible to </div><div class="t m0 x16 h14 ycf9 ff30 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be. My new teacher was an easygoing man with a real affection for children. He seemed to like </div><div class="t m0 x16 h14 ycfa ff30 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">us as we were, not only for what he could make of us. He was especially gentle with me. The </div><div class="t m0 x16 h14 ycfb ff30 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other children, so used to my father’s rule, took advantage of his leniency and the standard of </div><div class="t m0 x16 h14 ycfc ff30 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">work went down. It did not, however, have that effect on me. At first I kept up my standard of </div><div class="t m0 x16 h14 ycfd ff30 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">neatness, accuracy and attention, because my father kept a watchful eye on my progress and </div><div class="t m0 x16 h14 ycfe ff30 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">behaviour, although I was no longer in his class, and he inspected my exercise books regularly. </div><div class="t m0 x16 h14 ycff ff30 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But soon I was doing my best simply to please my teacher, and to win his praise. In a few weeks </div><div class="t m0 x16 h14 yd00 ff30 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I soared up to the top of the class and began to enjoy school.</div><div class="t m0 x16 h14 yd01 ff30 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I remember vividly the first time I was called up to the front of the class, not to be punished, </div><div class="t m0 x16 h14 yd02 ff30 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but to be praised. The teacher entered the room, picked out an exercise book from the pile on </div><div class="t m0 x16 h14 yd03 ff30 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his table, and said, “Kofi, come here.” The room swam before my eyes, I felt sick, I could not </div><div class="t m0 x16 h14 yd04 ff30 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">move. How often during the year before had I heard those words. They were always the prelude </div><div class="t m0 x16 h14 yd05 ff30 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to misery. I felt again in imagination the stare of forty pairs of self-righteous eyes; heard again </div><div class="t m0 x16 h14 yd06 ff30 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the cold, cutting voice of my father reciting my disobedience or stupidity to forty pairs of ears; </div><div class="t m0 x16 h14 yd07 ff30 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">felt again the cut of the cane, and heard my own voice sob and gasp, although I had vowed to </div><div class="t m0 x16 h14 yd08 ff30 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">myself that this time I would make no sound.</div><div class="t m0 x16 h14 yd09 ff30 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But I was bewildered. I had nothing on my conscience. The exercise book which my teacher held </div><div class="t m0 x16 h14 yd0a ff30 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">contained nothing but my most painstaking work. I forced myself to my feet. Well, this teacher’s </div><div class="t m0 x16 h14 yd0b ff30 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worst punishments were light to anyone who had been in Standard l. But my heart cried out, </div><div class="t m0 x16 h14 yd0c ff30 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">“Not from you, not from you.” </div><div class="t m0 x16 h14 yd0d ff30 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Out in the front of the class I raised my eyes slowly to my teacher’s face. He was smiling. He put </div><div class="t m0 x16 h14 yd0e ff30 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a hand on my shoulder and turned me to face the class. “Look,” he said, “Kofi is the youngest </div><div class="t m0 x16 h14 yd0f ff30 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of you all, and he has done a beautiful piece of work. Can you all see?” he asked, holding my </div><div class="t m0 x16 h14 yd10 ff30 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">opened exercise book towards them. “Not a single mistake, beautiful figures, straight lines </div><div class="t m0 x16 h14 yd11 ff30 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">drawn with a ruler, proper spacing. Very good indeed, Kofi. Children, give him a clap.”</div><div class="t m0 x16 h14 yd12 ff30 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The class burst into applause. The same children who had so often watched my humiliation. </div><div class="t m0 x16 h14 yd13 ff30 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Here, in the place that had held so much terror for me, I was actually being praised. The </div><div class="t m0 x16 h14 yd14 ff30 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">delightful experience was too wonderful for me to bear. I burst into tears, grabbed my exercise </div><div class="t m0 x16 h14 yd15 ff30 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">book from my astonished teacher, and ran back to my desk, amid the amazed exclamations and </div><div class="t m0 x16 h14 yd16 ff30 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">laughter of my friends. </div><div class="t m0 x16 h14 yd17 ff30 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But my teacher was a wise man. He made no comment, but refrained from praising me in front </div><div class="t m0 x16 h14 yd18 ff30 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the class for the next few weeks. Instead he gave me a quiet “Well done” as he passed me in </div><div class="t m0 x16 h14 yd19 ff30 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my desk. Later he called me out to work on sums on the blackboard, or to point out places on a </div><div class="t m0 x16 h14 yd1a ff30 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">map until I forgot that the front of the class was ever an undesirable place to be.</div><div class="t m0 xf h14 yd1b ff35 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"><span class="_ _87"> </span><span class="ff30">From</span>‘TheNarrowPath’<span class="ff30">by Francis Selormey </span></div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data="{&quot;ctm&quot;:[1.498566,0.000000,0.000000,1.498566,0.000000,0.000000]}"></div></div>
