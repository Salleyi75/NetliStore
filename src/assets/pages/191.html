The Swahili language and people were, and are, African. They had </div><div class="t m0 x16 h11 y1f8e ff98 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lived in the interior, but they moved to the coast well over a thousand years ago.  Like most other </div><div class="t m0 x16 h11 y1f8f ff98 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">African people, the Swahili were farmers and many continued to be so. But on the coast they </div><div class="t m0 x16 h11 y1f90 ff98 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">began to trade as well.</div><div class="t m0 x16 h11 y1f91 ff98 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">  What made the Swahili different from other African people who lived in the interior was that </div><div class="t m0 x16 h11 y1f92 ff98 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they used boats. A trader could move little more that 10 km a day on foot, whereas in their small </div><div class="t m0 x16 h11 y1f93 ff98 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sailing ships, they could move up and down the coast travelling 50 km a day, protected from the </div><div class="t m0 x16 h10 y1f94 ff98 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">great waves and storms of the Indian Ocean by a number of <span class="ff96">coral</span> <span class="ff96">reefs</span> and islands. Bigger ships </div><div class="t m0 x16 h11 y1f95 ff98 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could cover 150 km a day, crossing the ocean to India in two to three weeks.     </div><div class="t m0 x16 h11 y1f96 ff98 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">     Traders from Arabia, Persia and India bought goods which Swahili traders had collected </div><div class="t m0 x16 h10 y1f97 ff98 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from the interior and from other places along the coast. These included: gold, ivory, <span class="ff96">mangrove</span> </div><div class="t m0 x16 h10 y1f98 ff98 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">poles, tortoise shells, <span class="ff96">cowrie</span> beads, shells and slaves. In return, the Swahili traders bought cloth </div><div class="t m0 x16 h11 y1f99 ff98 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and glass beads from India, pottery from China and Persia.  But it was not only goods that were </div><div class="t m0 x16 h11 y1f9a ff98 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">exchanged. The Swahili language was carried all along the east coast. Later on the religion of </div><div class="t m0 x16 h11 y1f9b ff98 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Islam spread down the coast as people from Arabia and Persia came to live in the East African </div><div class="t m0 x16 h11 y1f9c ff98 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cities.</div><div class="t m0 x16 h10 y1f9d ff98 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">   The cities where the traders lived had <span class="ff96">harbours</span> and <span class="ff96">warehouses</span>.
